Some special considerations for registering apps (clients) on particular servers. 

When registering an app, you must provide (register) RedirectURLs that are allowed to be used.
For most servers and this Demo app you should register the following redirect URL: 
http://127.0.0.1:8081/api/oauth_redirect
However, servers have specific (and annoying) restrictions which require workarounds. 

Facebook 
Fb does not allow registered redirect URLs for testing, neither localhost or ip address (127.0.0.1). The workaround it to register 'http://localhost:8081' as site URL for your app. With a special flag (in Vita's oauth server record) the standard redirect URL with IP is twisted for FB: '127.0.0.1' is replaced with 'localhost'.

Windows Live 
1. Redirect URI should include full path: http://localhost:8081/api/oauth_redirect; does not allow IP address, so use localhost 
2. The docs and site use different terminology: client_id -> appId, client_secret -> password  (Oauth->WinLive)
3. Doc API examples suggest putting access token into URL parameter, but it actually works standard way (in Authorization header)
4. Registering apps portal: https://apps.dev.microsoft.com/#/appList
    (hard to find the link on dev site, really)

About Yahoo
Supports OAuth2 but does not allow IP address or localhost as redirect URLs, so it is impossible to test locally. 
There is a workaround (define localtest.me -> 127.0.0.1 in hosts file), but that's too much, so Yahoo is not shown in this app.
And it's definition is commented out in code that creates server records. Uncomment and use it if you really need it.
