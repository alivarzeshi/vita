Common redirect URL: 
http://127.0.0.1:8081/api/oauth_redirect

Facebook: 
Fb does not allow registered redirect URLs for testing, neither localhost or ip address (127.0.0.1). The workaround it to register 'http://localhost:8081' as site URL for your app. With a special flag (in Vita's oauth server record) the standard redirect URL with IP is twisted for FB: '127.0.0.1' is replaced with 'localhost'.

Twitter: does not support OAuth 2.0:

Windows Live 
1. Redirect URI should include full path: http://localhost:8081/api/oauth_redirect; does not allow IP address 
2. The docs and site use different terminology: client_id -> appId, client_secret -> password  (Oauth->WinLive)
3. Doc API examples suggest putting access token into URL parameter, but it actually works standard way (in Authorization header)
4. Registering apps portal: https://apps.dev.microsoft.com/#/appList
    (hard to find the link on dev site, really)
