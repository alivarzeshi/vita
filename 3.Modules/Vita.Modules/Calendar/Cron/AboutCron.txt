This folder contains implementation of scheduling spec CRON used in Unix/Linux: 
https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cron

There are a few extensions implemented here: 
1. Additional shift direction specifier for W (workday) symbol. By default, with W specifier if result date falls on weekend, it is shifted to nearest date (Sat -> Fri, Sun -> Mon), but without crossing month boundary. 
  We support the following additional specifiers: 
    W< - always shift to earlier day (Fri) and allow crossing month boundary
    W> - always shift to Mon and allow crossing month boundary

2. # symbol in Day-of-week field allows specifying occurrence number: Fri#3 - run every third Fri of the month. 
  We extend it by stating that ?#5 matches the LAST occurrence (?#4) if there are only 4 week days. Ex: 
   Fri#5 matches 4th Fri if the month has only 4 Fridays.
3. Similarly to previous section, 31 in day field matches the last day of month, if the month has less than 31 days
4. Standard implementation does not allow specifying both Day and DayOfWeek fields. We allow both, so you can schedule to run only on Fri 13, in a months with day 13 being Friday; see CronTests in Extended Unit Tests project.
